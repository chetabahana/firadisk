# firadisk
A Windows driver to read GRUB4DOS' drive map table and use GRUB4DOS RAM drives in Windows. 

Can run in
- Windows XP 32-bit
- Windows Server 2003 32-bit
- Windows 7 32-bit
- Windows 7 64-bit (Test Mode)

Note:
- This code is not mine. I just found it works.
- I forked from [grub4dos/firadisk](https://github.com/grub4dos/firadisk) and put the [latest releases](https://github.com/chetabahana/firadisk/releases/tag/0.0.1.30).
- See more detail on the forum discussion: [FiraDisk (latest = 0.0.1.30)](http://reboot.pro/index.php?showtopic=8804)

Thanks for your kind understanding.
